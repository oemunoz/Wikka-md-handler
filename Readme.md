## What is this?
Yes, this is a markdown parser for [WikkaWiki](http://wikkawiki.org/HomePage) for Markdown, the magic is from the [Cebe Markdown parser](http://markdown.cebe.cc/).

Easy steeps:

1. Put this repo on "/plugins/handlers/md" directory.

2. Add the ".md" support to your Wakka.class.php file, this like on the example located on this repo "examples/Wakka.class.php.example".

The detalled installed is explain on the next points:

## Why?
By defect WikkaWiki has their own formatting rules (these rules work like a charm), but on this days is very common to write all cain of documentation on Markdown, Markdown is the prefered formatting code for all cain of projects. I dont have a problem to know both ways of formatting, but is a lot of work traduce from one to the other, this plugin works on this point.

## How?
This plugin works in two ways (both if you wish), supose that mydoc and mydoc.md contains a document on Markdown format:

1. With a Handler md.
For example:
```
 wikka.php?wakka=mmymdoc/md
```

1. With a document that finish on ".md".
For example:
```
 wikka.php?wakka=mmymdoc.md
```

### How install it?
This plugins has two behaviors:

#### Install the handler:
The first is like a simple Handler, this meaning that you have to add "/md" to the end of the url. In any case you have to install the handler for both opions:

1. Drop this repo on your "/plugins/handlers/md" directory.

Directory Estructure:

```bash
cd plugins/handlers/
git clone https://github.com/oemunoz/Wikka-md-handler.git md/
```

Now, If you completed this, create a new document like this:

~~~~
wikka.php?wakka=mmymdoc
~~~~

~~~~markdown
# Cacti docker container

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

```css
.example {
		font-size: 2em;
	}
```
~~~~

And try to acces with:

~~~~
wikka.php?wakka=mmymdoc/md
~~~~

#### Configure for automatic access:
If you are like me, you want to access to the document direct without adding "/md", then you have to add the support for the ".md" extencion on your wikis documents.

Edit the follow code near to the end of "libs/Wakka.class.php", backup your original file and the new must be like:

```php
<?php ....
elseif( $this->GetHandler() == 'show' && pathinfo($this->GetPageTag(), PATHINFO_EXTENSION) == 'md' && $this->page['body'] != '' )
{
  // Hugly handler but util.
  $this->Handler($this->handler = 'md');
  echo $this->Header();
  echo $this->Handler($this->GetHandler());
  echo $this->Footer();
}
.... ?>
```
On any case I leave a copy of my Wakka.class.php on the project/expamples/ directory.

From now you can create mmymdoc.md and the system gonna to use the Markdown parser automaticly. (you can access to the edit page with dobleclik like the normal way.)

```
 wikka.php?wakka=mmymdoc.md
```

## FAQs and TODOs

- The handler have another flavors of markdown?

> R: Yes the cebe parse have anothers flavors (traditional, GitHub, extra). By default is GitHub flavor, but you can change this on pd.php file. Check for the cebe documentation, and the [markdown GitHub]( https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) for the especific formated.

- The plugins works on with this handler?

> R: For now, is not, plugins like "files" and "Category" etc, are not availables with the md plugins. (I need some time for check if it is posible and/or necesary).

- [x] TODO: Ask for add the css and js on the header.php by default. Now the css and js are on the handler directory we dont need to copy.
- [ ] TODO: Check for the common div and html objets css styles, I only check the table css style.
